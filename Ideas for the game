We need to collect some ideas for what the game's going to be about. Please add your own! So far we have:

1. The adventures of an academic trying to find funding

2. A MUD (?!) where gamers find scraps of manuscript and have to merge and version them into a complete spell tome

3. Gamer has to visit the original 7 wonders, solve puzzle and collect tokens/clues for final puzzle
