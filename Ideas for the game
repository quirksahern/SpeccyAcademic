We need to collect some ideas for what the game's going to be about. Please add your own! So far we have:

1. The adventures of an academic trying to find funding

2. A MUD (?!) where gamers find scraps of manuscript and have to merge and version them into a complete spell tome

3. A game where you need to collect all the pieces of data your paper needs in time for that crucial conference

3.1 You could have to set up an experiment or two to get some of the data

3.2 Or navigate a mess of a filesystem to and re-format a spreadsheet

3.3 There could he a hidden shortcut: get an undergrad to do some grunt work for you

3.3.1 (Although it might not be easy to 'hide' a feature like that in a collaboratively made game :p)

4. A game about an academic lost in a surrealistically huge and labarynthine library

4.1 You need to find the book/books/papers/etc you're looking for and then get out somehow
